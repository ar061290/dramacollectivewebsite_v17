// The sun and moon earrings that hang from the theme switch (docs/earrings/SPEC.md): the light
// theme's sun, the dark theme's moon. The model (assets/models/earrings.glb, made by
// tools/earrings/build-earrings.mjs) holds both, each cut into its rigid parts (the star, the
// pendant, the links, beads and charms of its strands), each part's geometry about the point it
// hangs from, with its joint, mass, colliders and swing limits in the node's extras. The ear wire
// is not in the model: each earring hangs from the button by the top loop of its star.
//
// The parts are rigid bodies joined at those points, solved by XPBD (Müller et al., "Detailed
// Rigid Body Simulation with Extended Position Based Dynamics", 2020): positions, quaternions,
// velocities, and a diagonal inertia from each part's box and mass. Each joint is a spherical joint
// with no give at all (metal and stone do not stretch), with limits on how far the part may turn
// from its parent: further in the earring's plane than out of it, as a loop through a loop jams,
// and least about the loop itself (its twist), which also turns slowly back to face the page.
// The model's pose is the pose it hangs in, not wherever its weight would tip it: from the pendant
// down, gravity pulls each part at a point chosen for that, and the star hangs from the point of
// its loop that balances what hangs below. The air slows it a little and the loops slow its
// turning. Parts that do not hang from each other cannot pass through each other (soft spheres),
// nor back through the page. The star hangs from the theme button, wherever the bar has put it. A part
// taken hold of is pulled toward the pointer, by a pull stiff enough to follow and too weak to tear
// a loop open; let go, it swings back with the speed it had. All of this is stepped at a fixed 600
// steps a second, with no allocation per step. The solver leaves each joint a small fraction of a
// pixel apart; what is drawn closes it exactly (Rig.project).
//
// The drop is a spring (src/ui/spring.js, react-spring's model): the star's loop comes down out of
// the button and lands with one small jump (the only overshoot on the site, asked for by the
// owner). It does not stay: on that jump back up, once the rebound has stopped gathering speed, it
// carries straight on up into the button at that speed (LIFT), with no settling and no wait, and is
// gone about 1.3 s after it began to come down. Taken hold of on the way, it stops where it is
// while held (and comes back out if pulled down); sent up (let go, a second switch, the bar going
// away), it goes up at once, without a jump. The chain feels only a share of that spring's speed
// (`carry`): the rest of it the whole earring is carried, so it unfolds and swings as it lands,
// and is still swinging as it goes up, instead of being flung.
//
// It is lit as the site's other pieces are: the theme's stage light (the warm spot from above in
// the dark, the house lights up in the light), a faint slate rim, a soft room for the metal and the
// stones to reflect, and the cursor's gold glow as a small lamp held in front of the part under the
// pointer (as on the masks, src/scene/masks.js, and the statue, src/scene/thinker.js). One canvas
// under the button, drawn only while an earring is moving (src/ui/earrings.js places it), with no
// more pixels behind it than a laptop's screen needs (MAX_PIXELS).
