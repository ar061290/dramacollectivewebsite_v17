// Music, on by default: "the smell of old books, reading, writing and studying (a dark academia
// playlist)" by Dark Enigmatic (credited in the footer). The site opens with it playing unless the
// visitor has turned it off on an earlier page of this visit, or has asked their browser to save data.
// No browser lets a page start sound before the visitor has done anything on it (a scroll does not
// count), so on a first page the button shows that it is waiting, and the music starts with the
// visitor's first tap, click or key anywhere on the page.
// It plays from the site's own MP3 (public/music/the-smell-of-old-books.mp3) in a plain audio
// element. The file is the whole playlist (some 47 MB), so it is streamed: nothing of it is asked for
// until the music is wanted, and then only its first few bytes (the length) before playing from the
// chosen point, which is fetched from there on as it goes (in Chromium by the page itself, half a
// minute ahead, src/ui/musicStream.js; elsewhere by the browser).
//
// Each page starts the music somewhere new: a random point in the playlist, never its very start and
// never where the last page had got to, so every visit (and every page of it) opens on a different
// piece. Whether the visitor wants it on is remembered for this visit (sessionStorage), so the next
// page carries on playing if the browser lets it (a click on a link of the same site normally does;
// otherwise the button shows that it is waiting, and it starts with the visitor's next tap, click or
// key, on the button or anywhere else). It fades in and out, and pauses while the tab is hidden.
//
// Besides the button, it answers the play and pause shortcuts people already use:
//   - the system's own media controls, through the browser's media session: media keys, a touchpad
//     gesture set to play/pause (a three-finger tap on many laptops), headset buttons, the browser's
//     and the phone's own controls. Playing it from there while the tab is hidden is heard there too
//     (the visitor asked for it); otherwise a hidden tab still pauses it.
//   - K on the page, as on video sites, wherever the visitor is not typing;
//   - a three-finger tap on a touch screen.
// All of them turn it on or off just as the button does (and are remembered as the button is); a
// pause from outside the page with no media session (a headset unplugged) counts as turning it off.
