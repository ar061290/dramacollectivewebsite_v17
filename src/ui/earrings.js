// The earrings that hang from the theme switch (docs/earrings/SPEC.md): the switch is clicked, and
// the earring for the theme just chosen (the sun for the light, the moon for the dark) comes down
// out of the button, hanging from it by the top loop of its star, lands with a small jump and
// dangles (the scene and its physics are src/scene/earrings.js). It is large: from the star's top
// loop to its lowest charm, 60% of a laptop's window's height (SIZE), beside the page's heading.
// A visitor can take hold of it and pull it about; let go, it swings back. It does not stay: about
// 3 s after it has settled (about 5 s after the click) it goes back up into the button on its own,
// unless the pointer is on it or holds it, and then a moment after the pointer has left it or let
// it go. It goes up at once when the theme is switched again (the other comes down as it goes), and
// when the button leaves the screen (the bar sliding away, or the publication's bar going back up).
//
// There are none on a phone's narrow screen (under 768 px wide): no model, no canvas, no WebGL; the
// switch works as ever. Nor are there any where WebGL does not run well (no WebGL, a software
// renderer, a weak device: src/util/env.js), and there nothing of theirs is fetched either. On the
// other screens, once the page is idle after its curtain has opened, the model's bytes are fetched
// ahead (and the scene's code), but the scene itself (its WebGL context, the earrings on the GPU,
// their shaders) is made only when it is likely to be wanted: when the pointer comes near the
// switch, the focus reaches it, or it is pressed. A switch made before the scene is ready changes
// the theme at once, and the earring comes down when it is ready if that is soon (1.5 s), or not at
// all. Where the switch is above the page's heading (on a tablet held upright), the earring is
// drawn smaller, so that it hangs beside the heading and its lede rather than over them (FIT).
//
// One canvas under the button, drawn only while an earring moves. While an earring comes down or goes
// back up, the canvas shows nothing above the bar's lower edge but a narrow slot under the button, as
// wide as the top of the star that hangs in the bar at rest, so the pendant and its strands come out
// from behind the bar's edge and go back behind it, rather than being drawn over the bar and cut off
// across its middle. Over the earring, a transparent
// zone shaped to it (a clip-path of the parts' outlines) takes the pointer, and keeps a finger on
// the earring from scrolling the page, while the page around it keeps the pointer. With reduced
// motion there is no drop and no swing: the earring fades in hanging still, stays a moment and
// fades out, and cannot be taken hold of. Without WebGL there is none.
