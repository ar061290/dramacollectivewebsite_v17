// A spring, as react-spring makes them (the react-spring-physics skill's model), for code that
// steps its own time: a value pulled toward its target by a spring of the given tension, slowed by
// friction, with the given mass. The damping ratio is friction / (2 * sqrt(tension * mass)): below
// 1 the value passes its target and comes back (once, if just below 1); at 1 or above it never
// passes it. Changing the target or the config mid-way keeps the velocity the value has, so an
// interrupted motion turns rather than restarts. The site has no React: this is the same model in
// plain JS, stepped with whatever fixed time step its owner uses (src/scene/earrings.js steps it
// with its physics).
